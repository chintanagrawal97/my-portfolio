Hey there!

I'm Chintan Agrawal. This website was made to showcase all of what I can do and plan to do. Don't judge my writing based on this section though, this is by far my shoddiest work yet.

I got into development because computers have always fascinated me. `int i = 10;` creates an integer of value 10? _LIKE, WOW!_ But seriously, just seeing code getting converted to things we use regularly, like Facebook or Amazon, was no less than magic to me and that's where my quest to invent began.

I'm a Cloud Solution Engineer with Amazon Web Services. My expertise are in Big Data (Spark , Hive , Hadoop ) and I enjoy working on web development projects in my spare time with more focus on backend stuff.

I enjoy practising sports (basketball, cycling ðŸš²), reading thrillers ðŸ“š and listening to music. Both reading and sports give me the focus needed to maintain a good work/life balance required when working in IT. 

I created this website so I could showcase all this and through this process, make it easier for you to connect with me. If you like what you see, head over to the [contact section](#contact) below and send me a text. I would love to hear from you!
